# Disclaimer
At the moment this is written, window padding and the snake spawning in the middle of the window aren't working, there are some input lag problems, and being able to win the game by filling the entire window is untested, but it is included in the code and can be tested.

# CSnake
I wrote a simple cross-platform Snake engine in C and OpenGL in about 5 hours in total. I encountered problems that took me a bit to figure out right around when I was getting around making the snake grow when eating food. I had to shift array positions to make the snake grow, and I got a bit confused, but I eventually solved it. Other than things mentioned in the disclaimer everything should work, this is a proof of concept atm until I finish it off.
